Using Grace Interactively
=========================
It is possible to drive xmgrace from within your C++ program. This is particularly helpful with the following projects:

Forest fire model
Atomic Rain drops
Random walks

An example code is example_grace.cpp.

To build this (and other Grace programs) you do:
g++ -o example.out example_grace.cpp -l grace_np

This is a modified version of the example on the xmgrace home page:
http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/

The code, opens a window that shows the whole graph and then generates 2 data sets and plots them with different symbols. In addition for set 0 it kills the data on each loop and allows new data to be written to the set.
