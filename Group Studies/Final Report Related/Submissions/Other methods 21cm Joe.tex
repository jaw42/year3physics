The method of using the hyperfine transition of neutral Hydrogen from the ground state to study reionization could provide much more detail about the process of reionization than the Lyman break dropout method.

         \label{subsub:Hyperfine_Hydrogen}

The Hyperfine transition corresponds to the change in the two hyperfine levels of the hydrogen 1s ground state with an energy difference of 5.87433 µeV

To observe the hydrogen 21cm absorption spectrum, radio sources are needed. If the radio source is located before or during the epoch of reionization, it’s possible to see the structure of neutral hydrogen gas along the line of sight using the absorption of the 21cm line in the radio spectrum. Several features should be apparent blueward of the redshifted 21cm line: a decrement of flux due to the optical depth of the IGM along the line of sight at a particular redshift, which will vary along the line of sight due to changes in density and the ionization of the IGM and there will be areas of transmission and absorption due to ‘bubbles’ of photoionized hydrogen and dense areas or clouds of hydrogen.

	\label{subsub:Advantages_disadvantages_21cm}
The major advantage of observing the 21cm forest over the Lyman break technique is that it is possible to study the history of the reionization far more accurately, this is because the Gunn Peterson trough reaches zero flux for the lyman break technique with only a small fraction of hydrogen in the line of sight needed. 

The main reason this study did not use the 21cm absorption spectrum is that it requires far more careful consideration of the IGM.  This is quite a different setup from the broad assumptions that can be made for the lyman break technique, and therefore it was thought that with the time constraint of the project. MORE NEEDED HERE
