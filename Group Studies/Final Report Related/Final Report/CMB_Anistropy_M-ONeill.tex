\subsection{CMB Secondary Anisotropies} % (fold)
\label{sub:cmb_secondary_anisotropies}
	Over large angular scales, the CMB polarization contains key information concerning the evolution of ionization during the EoR. The CMB photons released during recombination experienced considerable Thomson scattering off free electrons. This scattering is imprinted onto the CMB anisotropy map, it introduces secondary anisotropies. This has the effect of removing anisotropies on smaller scales and introducing polarization anisotropies. By comparing the anisotropies observed with models of what the CMB would have looked like without re-ionization having taken place we can determine the electron column density during EoR.

	Using this data it is possible to calculate the period over which re-ionization took place. It is also possible to make measurements of the metal enrichment history of the IGM at the EoR. On-resonance scattering off metals, and the influence of inverse Compton scattering (the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) introduced additional signals into the CMB\cite{Monteagudo2006}. Studies in this field are expected to get a new impetus in the coming years with the results from the Planck telescope giving greater insight into the CMB anisotropies.
