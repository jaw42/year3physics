                        One such factor that will increase the time required to view a source is the reflectivity of the mirrors used on the telescope. The mirror reflectivity, given as a percentage, is the amount of light reflected by the mirror. Some of the light is absorbed as the mirror is not one hundred per cent efficient meaning not all photons striking the mirror reach the CCD. The reflectivity differs depending on the material used on the surface of the mirrors. Various optical coatings are produced and used depending on the wavelengths being observed, for example, the James Webb Space Telescope uses a gold coating which is particularly useful in the infrared region and also very durable due to the inert nature of Gold. The reflectivity of this gold coated mirror is in the region of 98--99\%\cite{Quantum_Coatings_Incorporated}. Other coatings regularly used include aluminium, which has a reflectivity in the region of 80--90\% and is utilised in the UV and IR range, as well as silver, which has a reflectivity in the range of 95--99\% and is utilised in the visible and IR range.

                        The definition of throughput is the ratio of the flux detected by a particular instrument in a given filter and the incoming flux measured over an area equal to the area of the telescope primary mirror\cite{WIRCam_Throughput}. The throughput is therefore the percentage of photons striking the primary mirror that reach the CCD and are recorded. This contributes to the time required to observe a source as not all the photons striking the primary mirror, originated from the source, will reach the CCD. As the number of photons reaching the CCD is fewer, a larger portion of time is required to obtain the sought after signal-to-noise ratio and so the overall observation lasts a longer period of time.

                Figure 1 shows that relationship between temperature and dark current for a custom designed CCD provided to the European Southern Observatory and shows clearly the increase in dark current at higher temperatures. CCDâ€™s are therefore cooled, often with the use of liquid nitrogen, to minimise this effect. The dark current itself is a relatively small electric current that flows through numerous photosensitive devices, and is one of the main sources of noise for a CCD.
