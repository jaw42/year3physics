  abstract={We use simulated Hubble parameter data in the redshift range 0 ≤ z ≤ 2 to explore the role and power of observational H ( z ) data in constraining cosmological parameters of the ΛCDM model. The error model of the simulated data is empirically constructed from available measurements and scales linearly as z increases. By comparing the median figures of merit calculated from simulated data sets with that of current Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data, we find that as many as 64 further independent measurements of H ( z ) are needed to match the parameter constraining power of SNIa. If the error of H ( z ) could be lowered to 3%, the same number of future measurements would be needed, but then the redshift coverage would only be required to reach z = 1. We also show that accurate measurements of the Hubble constant H 0 can be used as priors to increase the H ( z ) data's figure of merit.}

  abstract={The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant ( H 0 ) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ΛCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n s = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑ m ν < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34 +0.86 –0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0 . The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP +BAO+ H 0 , without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = –1.10 ± 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Y p = 0.326 ± 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature- E -mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21σ, compared with 13σ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature- B -mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/192/2/18/apjs374858ieqn1.gif] {$\Delta \alpha =-1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}1\pm 1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}4 (\rm statistical)\pm 1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}5 (\rm systematic)$} (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.}

  abstract={We present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with a photometric redshift of z = 10.7 +0.6 –0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z < 9.5 galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2σ). This J -dropout Lyman break galaxy, named MACS0647-JD, was discovered as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We observe three magnified images of this galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. The images are magnified by factors of ~80, 7, and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude AB (~0.15 μJy) in the WFC3/IR F160W filter (~1.4-1.7 μm) where they are detected at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 12σ. All three images are also confidently detected at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 6σ in F140W (~1.2-1.6 μm), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength Hubble Space Telescope filters (~0.2-1.4 μm), and lacking bright detections in Spitzer /IRAC 3.6 μm and 4.5 μm imaging (~3.2-5.0 μm). We rule out a broad range of possible lower redshift interlopers, including some previously published as high-redshift candidates. Our high-redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected a Bayesian photometric redshift prior. Given CLASH observations of 17 high-mass clusters to date, our discoveries of MACS0647-JD at z ~ 10.8 and MACS1149-JD at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated from lower redshifts. This would suggest that low-luminosity galaxies could have reionized the universe. However, given the significant uncertainties based on only two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop-off in number counts at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 suggested by field searches.}

  abstract={We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed continuum Lyman break "dropouts" beyond a redshift 7 conducted via very deep imaging through six foreground clusters undertaken with the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes. The survey has yielded 10 z -band and two J -band dropout candidates to photometric limits of J 110 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 26.2 AB (5 σ). Taking into account the magnifications afforded by our clusters (1-4 mag), we probe the presence of z > 7 sources to unlensed limits of J 110 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 30 AB, fainter than those charted in the Hubble Ultradeep Field. To verify the fidelity of our candidates we conduct a number of tests for instrumental effects which would lead to spurious detections, and carefully evaluate the likelihood of foreground contamination by considering photometric uncertainties in the dropout signature, the upper limits from stacked IRAC data and the statistics of multiply imaged sources. Overall, we conclude that we can expect about half of our sample of z -band dropouts to be at high redshift. An ambitious infrared spectroscopic campaign undertaken with the NIRSPEC spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory for seven of the most promising candidates failed to detect any Lyα emission highlighting the challenge of making further progress in this field. While the volume density of high-redshift sources will likely remain uncertain until more powerful facilities are available, our data provides the first potentially interesting constraints on the UV luminosity function at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 7.5 at intrinsically faint limits. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of the hypothesis that the bulk of the reionizing photons in the era 7 < z < 12 arise in low-luminosity galaxies undetected by conventional surveys.}

Detection of the source at 3.6 and 4.5 μm, corresponding to rest-frame optical emission, allows us to study the stellar population of this primeval galaxy. The broadband flux density at 4.5 μm is enhanced compared to the continuum at other wavelengths, likely due to the presence of strong Hα in emission. The derived Hα line flux corresponds to a star formation rate of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 140 M ☉ yr -1 , more than an order of magnitude larger than estimates from the ultraviolet continuum and Lyα emission line. The dust extinction required to explain the discrepancy is A V ~ 1 mag. The inference of dust at such high redshifts is surprising and implies that the first epoch of star formation in this galaxy occurred at z ~ 20.}
