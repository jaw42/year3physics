The mass and redshift of the lenses are known so equation~(\\ref{eq:Einstein_radius}) can be used to find the Einstein angle. The magnification can then be calculated from equation~(\\ref{eq:magnification_equation}). The flux from the images can be obtained from observations and can be used in conjunction with the magnification factor to calculate the intrinsic brightness of the source in bands redward of the drop from equation~(\\ref{eq:mu_magnification}). Using model galaxy spectra, the flux in the band blueward of the drop can be estimated. This gives a lower limit on the neutral hydrogen fraction, since there must be at least enough to absorb the flux missing in the galaxy's spectrum\\cite{lower_limit_H}.\n\n1 match in 1 file\n",
