\subsection{Assumptions Made}
	The mathematical model being used in our program is limited by certain assumptions about the universe that we are working in. Some of these are generally held to be true and are accepted widely in the scientific community, others are due to the constraints of what we can mathematically program and the availible data.
	
	A major assumption that we are making throughout our work on re-ionisation concerns the type of universe that we exist in. This includes the relative densities of matter with respect to radiation and dark energy
