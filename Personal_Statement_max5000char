Physics was my first foray into the world around me. I wanted to be able to explain "why", not just observe and state "what". This is why a degree in physics was an obvious first route into academia. I enjoyed the challenges of the high mathematical content and worked hard at the weekly problems set, but I started to realise that the maths wast what interested me. Instead, it was the getting my hands dirty solving a problem that had been set to test our ingenuity. It was the lab session that required us to sit in front of a new set of equipment and learn how to use it, get used to the software provided to interact with it and carry out a full experiment with it. I enjoyed this form of trial and error combined with very knowledgeable people who were on hand to lend us just enough help so that we could complete the task ourselves.

Before I reached university, I had started playing about with computers. I liked to try to customise my old laptop to look and behave just how I wanted it to and to be as fast and responsive as I could make it. I began digging around in the inner workings of Windows XP dynamic list library files to customise icons and remove unnecessary functionality. I quickly decided that a more open approach was needed and so began looking into the open source world of Linux. I installed multiple different distributions and enjoyed the challenge of sorting out a seemingly useless computer with no MBR and finding that it could be fixed with some simple tools. 

When these two interests met, and I realised how much the open source was doing, and that the academic world was readily making use of, researching and contributing back I was surprised to find how useful many of the skills I had inadvertently taught myself were. I found that I was able to increase my work flow by easily login into my university user area via SSH and sharing relevant bits of work with fellow group members via Git. It was the unnoticed network behind the scenes that was keeping the advancement of academic research going. They say the the internet was designed to ease the sharing of information within a group and has now grown into something much more useful and impressive, but I see that initial goal as the biggest and most important achievement. This is an amazing area of human achievement that is possible because of the work of computers and those that understand them.

After two years of being a physics undergraduate worked for the summer at the security and aerospace company, BAE Systems. Here, I was part of a team working for the communications company Three Mobile. We were involved in the development and maintenance of the website and webstore. My part in the team involved creating an application to aid the development of webpages by simplifying the task of cleaning cascading style sheet (CSS). I was told to use the Java language to achieve this, so started by investigating the task, what would need to be completed and then learning the Java language as I had no experience of this language. I greatly enjoyed this challenge which involved learning a number of very useful skills including programming, web development and team work, as well as presentation skill as I gave a talk summarizing my work to senior members of the team.
