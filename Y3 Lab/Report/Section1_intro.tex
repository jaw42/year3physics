This experiment involves examining the interactions of neutrons with matter through two experiments using two different detectors. The first detector, a sodium iodide scintillation detector will be used to measure the binding energy of the neutron, and secondly, using a boron-trifluoride counter, measure the moderating properties of water on fast neutrons as a function of radius from a central source.
