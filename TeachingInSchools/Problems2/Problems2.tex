\section{Reflecting}
	Two periscopes are constructed as shown below. In each case, the periscope is used to observe a person with the word BEN written on their t-shirt. In each case, the light is reflected from mirror 1 to mirror 2 and then to the observer. For each design, what is the orientation of the word as viewed by the observer?

\section{Recombining}
	A narrow beam of white light passes through a glass prism. The light is dispersed into its constituent colours. Can these rays be recombined into white light by passing them through a second prism?
