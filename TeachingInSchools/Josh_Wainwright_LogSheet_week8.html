                  <li>This week, I gave a demonstration to the class on transformers and how they are used to carry electricity from power stations to local homes. this was to tie in with the work they have been doing on power generation. With the teacher, I had an opportunity to try the demonstration myself and check that it worked etc.</li>
                  <li>This was the first time that I had led a part of the lesson to the class as a whole. I found the experience challenging, and was nervous about making mistakes. I feel that it could have gone worse, but that I did miss out a few key details during my explanation that the students needed to know.</li>
                  <li>I also led the first after school session for university style physics. I felt that this went very week. the students that came were keen and interested Yi chat about the problems that I have them. there was one student in particular who was very intelligent and thinking in the right way for the questions, so I tried to use his enthusiasm to guide the others, making sure that he did not answer all of the questions leaving nothing for the others.</li>
                  <li>As planned, I gave out the answers to the problems and said that we would go through any that raised issues or people had questions about next week. this should allow to gauge if any of the students used the problems outside of the session.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>This week gave me an incite into the skill of teachers, and their ability to make teaching look easy, and the huge importance of experience to the effectiveness of a teacher. My lack of experience meant that I did have trouble when giving the demonstration and the subsequent explanation with remembering what information I needed to include and what facts should be taught.</li>
                  <li>I also was able to see the value of close contact teaching, where the teacher is not just lecturing from the front of the class. During the university physics session, it was clear that the students enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the problems and feel free to question and, where they were confident enough, to contradict me, and I felt that this was a great way of getting them to think about the problem when trying to break it down.</li>

                  <li>As explained, I did have problems when talking to the larger group. This I felt, was a matter of experience and being comfortable with being in the position of responsibility, even if just for a short time.</li>
                  <li>Because of mock exams there were not as many students at the after school session as had expressed interest, but this might improve next week.</li>
