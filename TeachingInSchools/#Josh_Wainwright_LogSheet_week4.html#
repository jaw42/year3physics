              <li>Provided assistance and gave help to those who needed it while a year 12 class were doing a practice exam. Since it was the first such test they had attempted, the students were allowed to ask for help.</li>
              <li>I used suggestions and gave only minimal hints to small groups at a time so that the students could work out the correct answers themselves.</li>
              <li>I also helped to lead a year 10 lesson where the students were beginning work on a piece of Astronomy coursework. This involved research using the internet and the use of the Liverpool Telescope website to apply for observation time. I helped to organise the class during their work and to explain the aims and direction of the coursework as well as helping with any problems that arose when using the LT system.</li>

              <li>When in the year 12 lesson, it is very easy to just reply to questions with the answer and then move on. I found however, that the students themselves respond much more eagerly, after some encouragement, if only a clue or suggestion in the right direction is given so that they can reach the answer themselves. I found that this has to be balanced with concerns of speed, so that an teacher does not spend of their time with one group, as well as judging student by student, how much help to give and when they need more information.</li>
              <li>With the year 10 group, I was impressed with the teacher at how he was able to use the facilities available, the Liverpool Telescope and website, to engage the students in a way that would be very difficult otherwise. The professional nature of the booking system, combined with the results that each were separately waiting to receive from their application to the telescope, meant that they were much more eager to engage in the coursework. The later details of the coursework will be heavily influenced by the decisions and results that they get near the start, so they were able to see how what they were doing was to be helpful to them. This feedback between different parts of an extended project is important to maintain enthusiasm.</li>
