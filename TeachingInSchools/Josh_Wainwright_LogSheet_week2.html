            <ul>
              <li>Worked with a class of year 11 physics students as they prepare for A-level physics practical exam</li>
              <li>Provided help and assistance where necessary to groups who needed it. All students were very new to practical work so, as an introduction, all were free to ask any questions and receive any help necessary.</li>
              <li>Challenged students in way to improve experiment both in terms of experimental procedure and scientific rigour. </li>

            <ul>
              <li>As an introduction, the students had to be taken back to very basics. All the students knew the outcome of the experiment and so some had trouble learning the experimental skills this way, however, had the experiment been harder, many would not have been able to cope with all of the things that had to be taken in.</li>
              <li>A very good method in this case, for impressing upon the students the style of marking and what would be expected of them was to get the students themselves to mark each other's work, led through the mark scheme by the teacher.</li>
              <li>Many were surprised at the intricate nature of the marking.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Some issues were encountered in the relative speed of the students at performing experimental work, so some were finished well before others. This time could then be used to do further readings, improve experimental procedure or be challenged about parts of the experiment they had conducted to check understanding.</li>
              <li>I might have been prone to forgetting some minor organisational necessities, would need to be used to the structure of leading the students through step by step at this early stage. </li>

              <li>Aid in the planning process of a lesson so that I can be more integrated, working up to small group leadership soon.</li>
              <li>Begin planning and implementation of Teaching in Schools project. Enquire to teacher as to lunchtime vs. after-school availability. Maybe gauge student interest during class as small example subset.</li>
