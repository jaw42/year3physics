            <ul>
              <li>This week I planned and delivered a full one hour lesson to the lower sixth form class that I have been working with previously</li>
              <li>I used the exercise book to plan a lesson on work, power and efficiency which the class has been introduced to in lower years and are the final topics that are to be covered this year.</li>
              <li>The lesson that I gave was the second half of a double period that the class has with the same teacher. This meant that I was able to observer the teacher with the class and get a feel for the dynamic that she has with them as well as to get used to the standard of work and the eagerness of the participation so that I could tailor my teaching to support this. I found that the class as a whole was eager to answer the questions I posed them, but that there was a set of regular students who would answer the questions more readily. I tried to encourage the rest of the class to engage by posing the questions directly at individual pupils, or at specific groups or tables.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>I got a good experience of how it is to have a full lesson that must be structured and well laid out such that all of the content is covered to a detailed level, making sure that everyone has understood and taken the content in, but also that the lesson must not miss out any of the key concepts or move too quickly over more complex concepts.</li>
              <li>I found the process of planning the lesson difficult, structuring the content in a logical way, but found that once the broader areas were in place, I was able to include the details organically as I was teaching using the plan as a general structure.</li>

              <li>The only problem that I encountered, apart from nervousness at the start of the lesson, was timing. Though I feel that the whole class had a good understanding of the topic by the end of the lesson, I did have to speed up towards the end to include everything. I used the opportunity to set some short homework about the lesson's content to check that all had understood.</li>
