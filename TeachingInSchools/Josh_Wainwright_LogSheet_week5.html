					<li>This week I arrived early to talk to some of the students who are thinking of taking physics to university level and to arrange a session to look at university level problems. It was decided that after school on Monday is better than lunch times. The first will be next week (11th Feb). </li>
					<li>Because the school is on a 2 week timetable, I joined a year 10 class and not the class that I was with last week. This class was working on a follow up to a lesson about asteroid impacts on the earth. I helped in the class with computer work and gave guidance and challenged those who were progressing quickly.</li>
					<li>I also rejoined the year 9 class from last week, though in a different lesson. Here they were giving presentations they had prepared on different methods of energy generation. I was able to check their understanding of their subject by asking questions and discussing the answers in their groups. We looked at the research they had done on the subject and discussed their understanding of the information provided by the other groups on other forms of energy generation.</li>

					<li>The students that were interested in the university physics sessions were eager to know about university life and the style of the course. I was impressed at their eagerness and forward thinking in several areas. I feel sure that they will benefit from being pushed in their maths and conceptual physics.</li>
					<li>I attended a school wide staff meeting, to be introduced quickly to the staff as a whole as well as the head and deputy heads. There was a lot of feedback from events and courses that had been attended and a general sharing of knowledge for the benefit of the school as a whole and the pupils in particular. It was also interesting to hear of the provisions and arrangements that are made for a verity of students for different reasons and impressed upon me the need to get to know the students so that they can each be catered for in their learning if they need special attention, or extension exercises. Not having the experience of the teachers, I was surprised at the number of students and their respective requirements that each teacher must know and remember in order to be able to provide for them smoothly.</li>
					<li>I appreciated the benefit of different methods of learning that the pupils can learn from. The presentations were a very good way for the students to research a topic in depth and share the knowledge with the class. The way the teacher organised the learning of the other students, by requiring them to take notes under specific headings for each talk, was a clever way to ensure that the knowledge was passed on by the students to their fellows.</li>
					<li>The difference between the attitude of the pupils to the subject being studied (by asking intelligent questions during the talks), I also found very interesting. I was able to compare this impression from a grammar school to my experiences at a state comprehensive school where the students were far less keen to participate, in general. </li>

					<li>I asked a couple of the physics teachers who teach sixth form students to notify them about the possibility of the lunchtime/after school sessions so that I could talk to those who are interested quickly about the details. The short discussion with those who had expressed interest was very useful. It showed that there is definite interest for the sessions, and the enthusiasm means that I am confident that the pupils will benefit from them.</li>
					<li>I was able to interact with some of the students in the year 9 lesson in smaller groups than the whole class to discuss their talks and their understanding behind them.</li>
					<li>I have not started writing the questionnaire but have written a fairly detailed problem sheet with answer scheme that I shall use with the students in the first after school session next week, and which I shall give them so that they can attempt some other questions in their own time.</li>
