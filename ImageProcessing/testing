this is a test file that i have added to the git repository for the new folder.

This is how you add more info to the file that is hosted on git

Now if i wanted to update the work that i had been doing on this lovely testing file, i could just save it, 

There, done. And now if i change in a remote location, say using the web interface, 
i can then save it again and find it back on my pc,

Now i'm going to have a few practices with the saving to the web, ie uploading.
