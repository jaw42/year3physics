	\label{sec:tomographic_reconstruction}
	Tomographic reconstruction involves the creation of an image of an object taken through a particular slice by recombining the data collected from a set of line integrals across that object in the plane of interest. The word tomography comes from the Greek \textit{tomos} meaining section and \textit{graphein} meaning to write, so tomography ios simply writing `parts' of an object, in this case an image of a single plane through that object.
